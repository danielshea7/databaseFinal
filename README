DATABASE FINAL PROJECT

THIS APPLICATION CONNECTS TO AN SQLite DATABASE AND ALLOWS THE USER TO PERFORM MULTIPLE ACTIONS SUCH AS ADD ACCIDENT, SEARCH ACCIDENTS, AND RETRIEVE ACCIDENT DATA. 

DATABASEFINAL.JAVA IS WERE MOST OF THE MEANINGFUL CODE IS. THE SQLite WOULD NEED TO BE CONFIG TO YOUR MACHINE TO TEST.

My application is not a looping menu, so multiple actions cannot be done in one instance of running the program.
The application will need to be run for as many times as things need to be done. This was for simplicity and fits to the project requirements.

I aimed to have my application be self explanatory. Each prompt explains the exact format needed to continue. 

The space bar will not be required in entry. I did this to make testing easier. The formats for entry are given in the prompts.  

Although not thoroughly tested, my application fits all criteria asked in the project description.
